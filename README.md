# What is Mosalloc

The Mosaic Memory Allocator – Mosalloc – allows its users to back the memory of an application with some arbitrary predetermined heterogeneous collection of pages with different sizes (4KB, 2MB, and/or 1GB) on an x86 machine. All memory allocations of the application that links against Mosalloc are fulfilled by Mosalloc.
The allocator is primarily useful for architectural virtual memory studies. It allows researchers to construct mathematical models that predict the runtime of applications executing on top of some newly proposed virtual memory design. This methodology requires a partial simulation of only the said newly proposed memory subsystem, as opposed to a full "cycle accurate" simulation of the entire processor. The resulting mathematical models are much more accurate than preexisting
models.
For more information about Mosalloc, its usages, and motivation, please refer to the paper which was published in [MICRO '20](https://www.microarch.org/micro53/).

# Technical Details
Mosalloc is implemented as a dynamic library and can be pre-loaded before glibc (using LD_PRELOAD environment variable) and hooks all memory requests made by an application. 
- First, Mosalloc intercepts `malloc()` requests by hooking the `morecore()` function, which `malloc()` calls when it needs to extend the heap. 
- Second, Mosalloc intercepts direct invocations of `brk()`, `mmap()` and `munmap()`, the primary memory system calls in Linux, by overriding their glibc wrapper functions.

Mosalloc is an independent library so it does not require modifying the existing source code or rebuilding the application. Additionally, Mosalloc is implemented in user-space and does not require kernel modification.

Mosalloc allows the user to back the address space of applications with arbitrary combinations of page sizes. To accomplish this, Mosalloc manages three pools that serve the three types of memory requests in Linux: 
1. `brk()` calls
2. anonymous `mmap()` calls
3. file-backed `mmap()` calls.

The user should specify the layout of the `brk()` pool and the layout of the anonymous `mmap()` pool through a set of environment variables, which Mosalloc takes as an input. The `brk()` and anonymous `mmap()` pools can mix pages of different sizes. Mosalloc allocates these pools via the `mmap()` system call with the relevant flags (MAP_HUGETLB, MAP_HUGE_2MB, and MAP_HUGE_1GB). The file-backed pool is backed only with 4KB pages because Linux does not support file-backed `mmap()` calls with hugepages; these `mmap()` calls are served from the page cache, which Linux manages only with 4KB pages. These three pools are allocated (dynamically) on-demand.

Mosalloc manages the aforementioned three pools dynamically, which means it extends and shrinks them on-demand. Each one of the three pools are allocated contagiously in virtual and physical spaces. At first, Mosalloc allocates the three pools at once to preserve their virtual addresses and to ensure no addresses collisions occur when these pools are extended. After that Mosalloc preserved and saved the pools base addresses, it deallocates (shrinks) them. For each new memory allocation request, Mosalloc will serve the request using the FirstFitAllocator to find the first virtual address which fits the request size, and extends the pool if required (in the physical space).

# Mosalloc Data Structures
1. [First Fit Allocator (FFA)](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc/blob/master/include/FirstFitAllocator.h)
Memory allocations in the anonymous `mmap()` and file-backed `mmap()` pools are served according to the *first fit* algorithm. We chose this algorithm because it performs better than the alternatives of *best fit* and *worst fit* in terms of runtime complexity and memory utilization.
The FirstFitAllocator is used to allocate memory in the virtual space and to track previous allocations, i.e., to find the first free slot in the virtual space which fits the requested size. The physical memory space is managed using the HugePageBackedRegion.

2. [Huge Page Backed Region (HPBR)](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc/blob/master/include/HugePageBackedRegion.h)
As Mosalloc serves the memory allocation requests using the FirstFitAllocator and pools are allocated dynamically, it could be that the new memory allocation request was served from the current top of the pool. In this case, Mosalloc should extend the pool in the physical space. For managing the physical space of the pools HugePageBackedRegion is used for that purpose which is responsible for extending and shrinking the pool (in the physical space) when required. HugePageBackedRegion uses the `mmap()` and `munmap()` system calls to extend and shrink the pools.
Similarly to the system heap allocation behavior, Mosalloc frees memory only from the top of the pools. While this design simplifies the pool management, it may lead to memory fragmentation compared to glibc `munmap()`, which immediately reclaims memory regions. We measured the additional memory consumption to be less than 1% for our tested workloads. We leave the development of better, more efficient memory management algorithms for future work.

3. [Huge Pages Configuration (HPC)](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc/blob/master/include/HugePagesConfiguration.h)
Reads and maintains the Mosalloc input configuration written by the user to a specific environment variables (see [Mosalloc Input](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc#mosalloc-input) section for more details).

4. [Memory Interval List](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc/blob/master/include/MemoryIntervalList.h) 
This class implements an interval-list to be used by the HugePageBackedRegion. The HugePageBackedRegion divides the pool virtual space into intervals (according to the input Mosalloc got by the environment variables) and each interval is allocated uniformly with the same page size. For example, if one of the pools was configured with size=1300MB and the following huge pages regions: 2MB pages at [20MB-40MB) and 1GB pages at [100MB-1124MB), then the interval list will contain 5 intervals: 

    4KB pages | 2MB pages | 4KB pages | 1GB pages | 4KB pages
    --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------
    [0-20MB) | [20MB-40MB) | [40MB-100MB) | [100MB-1124MB) | [1124MB-1300MB]

5. [Memory Allocator](https://github.com/technion-csl/mosalloc/blob/master/include/MemoryAllocator.h)
This is the main interface used by Mosalloc to allocate memory from one of the three pools according to the intercepted call.

# Mosalloc Input
Mosalloc pools can be configured using environment variables. All of these environment variables are mandatory to run Mosalloc (users can use the runMosalloc script which configures these environment variables using a user friendly arguments). Here is a table summarizes these environment variables, their corresponding arguments in runMosalloc script, and their meaning:
environment variable | runMosalloc argument | description
-------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------
HPC_MMAP_POOL_SIZE | anon_pool_size (aps) | The anonymous `mmap()` pool size
HPC_MMAP_1GB_START_OFFSET | anon_start_1gb (as1) | The start offset of the 1GB hugepages region in the anonymous `mmap()` pool
HPC_MMAP_1GB_END_OFFSET | anon_end_1gb (ae1) | The end offset of the 1GB hugepages region in the anonymous `mmap()` pool
HPC_MMAP_2MB_START_OFFSET | anon_start_2mb (as2) | The start offset of the 2MB hugepages region in the anonymous `mmap()` pool
HPC_MMAP_2MB_END_OFFSET | anon_end_2mb (ae2) | The end offset of the 2MB hugepages region in the anonymous `mmap()` pool
HPC_BRK_POOL_SIZE | brk_pool_size (bps) | The anonymous `brk()` pool size
HPC_BRK_1GB_START_OFFSET | brk_start_1gb (bs1) | The start offset of the 1GB hugepages region in the `brk()` pool
HPC_BRK_1GB_END_OFFSET | brk_end_1gb (be1) | The end offset of the 1GB hugepages region in the `brk()` pool
HPC_BRK_2MB_START_OFFSET | brk_start_2mb (bs2) | The start offset of the 2MB hugepages region in the `brk()` pool
HPC_BRK_2MB_END_OFFSET | brk_end_2mb (be2) | The end offset of the 2MB hugepages region in the `brk()` pool
HPC_FILE_BACKED_POOL_SIZE | file_pool_size (fps) | The file-backed `mmap()` pool size
HPC_ANALYZE_HPBRS | analyze | Let Mosalloc analyzes the actual sizes of the three pools and write them to a separated file for each sub-process
HPC_MMAP_FIRST_FIT_LIST_SIZE | N/A (hardcoded to 1MB) | The size of the first-fit list which manages the anonymous `mmap()` allocations. The first-fit list is statically allocated with a predefined size to prevent an allocation recursive calls.
HPC_FILE_BACKED_FIRST_FIT_LIST_SIZE | N/A (hardcoded to 10KB) | The size of the first-fit list which manages the file-backed `mmap()` allocations.

runMosalloc script can be used to initialize these environment variables with a simple command line. For example, to run <app> with a 2MB anonymous `mmap()` pool which is allocated with only 2MB huge pages, a 1200MB anonymous `mmap()` pool with a 2MB region [20MB, 40MB) and additional 1GB region [40MB, 1064MB), and without file-backed `mmap()` pool (size=0) we can run the following command line:
```sh
$ ./runMosalloc.py -aps 2MB -as2 0 -ae2 2MB -bps 1200MB -bs1 40MB -be1 1064MB -bs2 20MB -be2 40MB -- <app>
```
Note: Please note that runMosalloc ensures that system is well configured to run Mosalloc and it will automatically disable the Transparent Huge Pages (THP) by setting it to never and will enable memory overcommit if required. These two configurations are done in runMosalloc by running the following commands:
``` 
$ sudo bash -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory"
$ sudo bash -c "echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled"
```

# Future work
Mosalloc, currently, supports only one window/region of each hugepage size in each pool. As a future work, we will add support for multiple windows/regions of each hugepage size for the `brk()` and anonymous `mmap()` pools.
Finally, we will be happy to get contributions.
